# libreMCM

The goal of libreMCM (libre Multi Compartment Modelling) is to be a free (free as in freedom) software for carrying out deterministic and probabilistic modelling.

Please note that the program is still WIP.

## Planned features

- Tools for sensitivity analysis
- Integrated radioactive decay and reactions
- Probabilistic modelling
- Support for Ecolego's file format
- A lot more

## How to build

In order to build libreMCM on Linux, run the following commands
```shell
mkdir build
cd build/
cmake ..
make
```

## How to use

The tutorial models can be run immediately by executing the executable after building. For creating a model check the manual pdf file or edit the tutorial files.
